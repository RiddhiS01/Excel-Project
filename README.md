# Excel-Project
This project aims to analyze trends in the data provided by a social media platform known as Social Buzz. The data includes information such as content categories, user engagement metrics, and more. Our analysis focuses on the top five categories of content, the months with the highest post frequency, and the overall user sentiment on the platform. We conducted the analysis using Excel pivot tables and presented the findings through charts and tables. In conclusion, we summarized the results to aid decision-making for the Social Buzz platform.
